<h1>BLUEPRINT FOR</br>
MUSHROOM CLOUD LA (Proximities)</h1>

<h2>The Plan</h2>
<p>
This Blueprint is an articulation of the intentions for Mushroom Cloud LA (Proximities) project (the “Project”), within an NFT environment that is evolving toward a Web 3.0 future.  Just as a blueprint for a building provides details for construction, this Blueprint is intended to embody the vision of Nancy Baker Cahill (the “Artist”) and her collaborators. This Project in its entirety is a reminder that we are not only accountable for the results of our actions, but that there is still a way by which we can consciously pull together and formulate a structure that supports life rather than continuing down a path to mutually-assured destruction.  This Blueprint and the interactivity that it contemplates, coincides with the conversations and innovation happening around efforts to connect various blockchains in a truly interoperable ecosystem.  Both this Project and the evolution of blockchain interoperability, in their own ways, reinforce the need for each of us to make use of our own networks and connections to be conduits and champions for positive and productive change.
</p>
<p>
However, building a meaningful network requires more than just intentions: it also requires action!  Recognizing the value of the artistic process beyond the initial creation of the work and the primary transaction is crucial to establishing legacy and an enduring vision. The owner of the Slipstream: Mushroom Cloud LA (Proximities) NFT (the “NFT”) is encouraged to actively engage with this Project as an innovator in an ongoing mutually-creative process, and to share the experience by circulating the NFT to as many others as possible.  With resale royalties allocated between the Artist and Wampum Codes, the Land Back/Climate Justice initiative of artist and collaborator Amelia Winger-Bearskin, every exchange provides an opportunity for the Project’s vision to be recognized anew.  The secondary transactions allow multiple Collectors to engage with the Artist, feel the sense of ownership of the artwork embedded in the NFT, and intentionally participate in advocating for environmentally sound practices.
</p>

<h2>The Details</h2>
<p>
Detail 1.	<strong>Acquiring the Work.</strong>  As soon as possible, but in any event within a reasonable time after purchasing the NFT, Collector will receive a token representing ownership of the Slipstream: Mushroom Cloud LA (Proximities) video (the “Video”).  Additionally, the primary Collector will receive a set of five (5) physical objects as further set forth in Section 3 below, and a printed copy of this Blueprint to accompany each of the five (5) objects.  Together, all of these components comprise the Project in its entirety and may be referred to as the “Artwork.”
</p>
<p>
Detail 2.	<strong>The NFT.</strong>  The NFT is minted on the Algorand blockchain.  The unique NFT is comprised of a metadata file with links on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to the Video, and this Blueprint.  (The following will be revised per the description of how Uncopied will deal with the NFT and back up plans in the event of blockchain or file storage failure) [As a backup measure, upon purchase, Collectors should download the digital files associated this NFT and store the files in a secure location. In the event that any or all of the links between the NFT and the associated digital files are broken or not properly functioning, Collector still will have and can enjoy the digital files.  The NFT will remain available on the blockchain.  It is imperative that Collector save the digital files and all information pertaining to the NFT for provenance, proper recordkeeping, and any required remediation.  In the event the link(s) between the NFT and one or more of the digital files is/are broken or not properly functioning, Collector may contact Artist at info@nancybakercahillstudio.com and Artist will use reasonable efforts to remedy the situation in a fair and practicable manner.  Otherwise, Artist may elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Section ___ below.]
</p>
<p>
Detail 3.	<strong>The Physical Objects.</strong>  The original purchase of the unique NFT is accompanied by physical objects consisting of five (5) cubes or ‘nodes’.  Each node consists of a firey orange base, referencing the increasingly intense fire danger prominent in the Southern California location of the Project.  At the center of each cube, a single, pearlescent ‘spore’ is suspended, representing the collector’s role in supporting and ‘germinating’ a personal mycelium structure and making a meaningful contribution to an interactive community. The five (5) nodes are all 2x2 inches in size. As a physical manifestation of this Blueprint, Collector is invited to ‘gift’ four (4) of the nodes to people in their community whom Collector wishes to include in this special network.  This exercise is intended to stimulate a generative force and create an enduring network of connections beyond the Collector.
</p>
<p>
The physical artworks may be retained by the original Collector and any recipients regardless of whether the NFT is resold.  The physical artwork(s) possessed by the Collector may be resold with or without the NFT at the Collector’s discretion.  At the time of the initial sale of the NFT, the physical works will accompany this sale as a gift with purchase to be valued at their replacement value for purposes of taxes, customs, or duties calculations.  The value of the physical works for resale purposes will be based on what the market determines the value to be.
</p>
<p>
Detail 4.	<strong>Right to Display the NFT.</strong>  Collector may display the NFT for personal use, or loan the NFT for public display in an institutional setting.  Any public display of the Video must be on a square monitor, preferably with no border, and must be accompanied by the embedded sound.  The public display of the Video should include this Blueprint.  The physical objects should only be displayed in conjunction with a display of the Video and this Blueprint.
</p>
<p>
Any public display of the NFT must include credit to Nancy Baker Cahill including a copyright notice as follows:
</p>
<p>
Slipstream: Mushroom Cloud LA (Proximities) by Nancy Baker Cahill
©2022 Nancy Baker Cahill.  All Rights Reserved.
</p>
<p>
Credit must also be given to important collaborators:
</p>
<p>
Legal: Sarah Conley Odenkirk
Sound Collaboration: Amelia Winger-Bearskin
Production: Jens Zalzala, Shaking Earth Digital
</p>
<p>
If the Blueprint is included as part of any display of the NFT, credit must be included to Sarah Conley Odenkirk as the author of the Blueprint text.
</p>
<p>
Artist retains a display copy of the NFT which she may loan out at her sole and exclusive discretion.
</p>
<p>
Detail 5.	<strong>Loaning the AR Component.</strong>  Similar to the traditional rules governing a loan of conceptual artwork, the NFT may be loaned for display as long as Artist or someone from Artist’s studio is notified and oversees the installation or context of display.  The loan must be made pursuant to a written agreement clearly establishing the duration of the loan and with the clear understanding that Collector must remain the owner of the NFT for the duration of the loan.  If the NFT ownership is transferred during the course of the loan, the loan agreement will be automatically terminated, and the transferring Collector will be solely responsible for any consequences of such termination.
</p>
<p>
Detail 6.	<strong>Use of Blueprint.</strong>  This Blueprint may be copied, redistributed, remixed,  transformed, and built-upon for any purpose including commercially, with credit given to Sarah Conley Odenkirk for the original crafting of this text along with a statement detailing any changes made.
</p>
<p>
Detail 7.	<strong>Representations and Warranties.</strong>  Artist represents and warrants that she is the creator of the Artwork associated with the NFT, and to the best of her knowledge, nothing in the Video, the physical objects, or the NFT violates any intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p>
Detail 8.	<strong>Intellectual Property Ownership.</strong>  Except as set forth above regarding the Blueprint, all intellectual property pertaining to the NFT, the Video, and the accompanying physical nodes, including but not limited to copyright, applicable moral rights, and trademark, remains with the Artist. Except as allowed by this Blueprint, under no circumstances is Collector allowed to reproduce the NFT, the Video, or the physical artworks in any medium or create derivative works without Artist’s specific written consent.  Collector’s purchase of the NFT entitles the Collector to ownership of that NFT, and the rights to display the NFT as set forth in Section 4 above, and to resell the NFT pursuant to the terms of this Blueprint.
</p>
<p>
Artist specifically retains the right to create derivative works and future installations.
</p>
<p>
Detail 9.	<strong>Ownership.</strong>  There is sometimes the misperception that by owning an artwork, a Collector owns all rights including intellectual property rights like copyright.  This is not the case with physical artwork, and it is also not the case with NFTs.  Even though a Collector does not have any intellectual property rights in the artwork associated with the NFT, there are definitely responsibilities that come with ownership.  The responsibilities that come with either collecting art or participating in society require attention and maintenance.  This transaction is no different, and thus, by purchasing this NFT, Collector agrees to participate in this NFT ownership pursuant to the terms of this Blueprint.
</p>
<p>
Detail 10.	<strong>NFT Resale.</strong>  Collector is free to sell the NFT at any time as long as that sale occurs completely on-chain, on Algorand or another blockchain compatible with Algorand, and the established resale royalty is paid to Artist and Artist’s collaborators.
</p>
<p>
Detail 11.	<strong>Term and Termination of Agreement.</strong>  While nothing is truly forever, Artist will use reasonable efforts to ensure that this NFT remains functional and the digital files attached are accessible for as long as reasonably practicable, which will hopefully be close to “forever”.  In the event of technological changes, migrations to new platforms or systems, or any other technology evolution or shifts not compatible with the structure and nature of the NFT; termination or destruction of the currency or blockchain on which the NFT is minted; or the inaccessibility or destruction of the link to the attached digital files for the aforementioned or any other reasons, and the Artist cannot reasonably remedy the situation, this Agreement will automatically terminate and Artist will have no further obligations hereunder.  Artist may also terminate this Agreement at any time for her sole convenience.  Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, Owner may retain legal ownership of any digital or physical assets in Owner’s possession, and will continue to be bound by any moral rights that exist with regard to the NFT and any physical objects acquired as a result of this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
Detail 12.	<strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong>  In the event any disputes arise out of this Agreement, the parties agree to resolve such disputes only by mutual agreement or mediation with a mutually-agreed-upon neutral third party.  The parties waive any and all rights to bring disputes to arbitration or litigation in any form or forum.  Each party will be responsible for its own attorney fees and costs.
</p>
<p>
Detail 13.	<strong>Disclaimer of Liability.</strong>  In no event will Artist, or any developers, collaborators, employees, agents, representatives, attorneys, or assigns, be liable or responsible for any loss or damage of the NFT or associated digital files due to any technological advancements, evolution of platforms or digital environments, or failure in any part of the system that results in link breakage, damage, or destruction of the NFT for any reason, including but not limited to any negligent action or inaction of the Artist or any developers, collaborators, employees, agents, representatives, or assigns.
</p>
<p>
Detail 14.	<strong>Effect of Future Regulations.</strong>  In the event that federal or state regulations are instituted in the future requiring NFT owners to adhere to rules, laws, or policies; take specific actions with regard to their NFT ownership; or provide additional information to comply with any governmental regulations including but not limited to IRS, SEC, or other international transaction standards intended to combat money laundering (AML), and fraud such as Know Your Client (KYC) regulations, Collector agrees to abide by such rules, laws, policies, regulations, and/or standards.  In no event will the Artist or any developers, collaborators, employees, agents, representatives, or assigns be responsible for any direct or indirect consequences of such future rules, laws, policies, regulations, and/or standards.
</p>
<p>
Detail 15.	<strong>Details.</strong>  In the event that Artist chooses not to exercise any part of the Details set forth in this Blueprint, such choice will not be interpreted as abandoning or waiving the importance of any of the Details of the Blueprint in the future.
